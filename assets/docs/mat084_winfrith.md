# MAT_084 — Winfrith Concrete

## When to use
- Practical concrete cracking setups and quick keyword definitions.

## Guidance
- `RO ~ 0.0023 g/mm³`, `PR ~ 0.2`
- `UCS = fc`
- `UTS` can be estimated from `fc` (depends on your convention)
- `FE` and `ASIZE` depend on aggregate size and calibration

Defaults are provided to guide users, not to replace calibration.
