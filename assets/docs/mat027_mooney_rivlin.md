# MAT_027 — Mooney–Rivlin Rubber

## When to use
- Rubber-like materials with large deformation (hyperelastic behavior).

## Notes
- `C10, C01` should be fitted from experimental curves (uniaxial / biaxial / shear).
- `PR ~ 0.49` indicates near-incompressibility.
- `K` is a penalty-like parameter for volumetric stability (depends on your setup).
